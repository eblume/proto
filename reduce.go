// progressive elements from `recv` *in order* - that is, `fn` may or may not
// be associative. If `recv` receives only one value, `fn` will not be called
// and the first and only value will be sent as the result. If `recv` receives
// no values, `nil` will be sent (as a Proto type) as the result. Regardless,
// `recv` will always receive one value and then be closed.

// Why no PReduce? Reduce is a tricky function to get right. The above version
// allows for both associative and non-associative reducing functions, and does
// this by having a well-defined order for reducing the received elements.
// In some cases, such as (particularly) computation-heavy instances where the
// reducing function can be made strictly non-associative, it would be very
// useful to allow reductions to happen in parallel.
//
// There are several approaches for this, but the obvious (to me) one was to
// create PReduce as a construct of PMap (Parallel Map) in which each invocation
// of PMap's mapping function takes a tuple of two elements and produces one as
// output, which is then recycled back in to the input channel. This seemed to
// work on paper, but caused deadlocking every time I tried it in Go. I'd love
// to see a working patch for this or any other Parallel-Reduce algorithm.
