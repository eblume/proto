	<pre><span class="comment">// proto gives Go operations like Map, Reduce, Filter, De/Multiplex, etc.</span>
<span class="comment">// without sacrificing idiomatic harmony or speed.</span>
<span class="comment">//</span>
<span class="comment">// The `Proto` type is a stand-in approximation for dynamic typing. Due to</span>
<span class="comment">// Go&#39;s powerful casting and type inference idioms, we can approximate the</span>
<span class="comment">// flexibility of dynamic typing even though Go is a statically typed language.</span>
<span class="comment">// Doing so sacrifices some of the benefits of static typing AND some of the</span>
<span class="comment">// benefits of dynamic typing, but this sacrifice is fundamentally required by</span>
<span class="comment">// Go until such time as a true &#39;Generic&#39; type is implemented.</span>
<span class="comment">//</span>
<span class="comment">// In order to use a Proto-typed variable (from here on out, simply a &#39;Proto&#39;),</span>
<span class="comment">// you will generally have to cast it to a type that you will know to use based</span>
<span class="comment">// on the semantics of your program.</span>
<span class="comment">//</span>
<span class="comment">// This package (specifically, the other files in this package) provide</span>
<span class="comment">// operations on Proto variables as well as some that make Proto variables out</span>
<span class="comment">// of &#39;traditionally typed&#39; variables. Many of the operations will require the</span>
<span class="comment">// use of higher-order functions which you will need to provide, and those</span>
<span class="comment">// functions commonly will need you to manually &#34;unbox&#34; (cast-from-Proto) the</span>
<span class="comment">// variable to perform useful operations.</span>
<span class="comment">//</span>
<span class="comment">// Examples of the use of this package can be found in the &#34;*_test.go&#34; files,</span>
<span class="comment">// which contain testing code. A good example of a higher-order function which</span>
<span class="comment">// will commonly need manual-unboxing is the `Filter` function, found in</span>
<span class="comment">// &#34;filter.go&#34;. `Filter` takes as its first argument a filter-function which</span>
<span class="comment">// will almost certainly require you to un-box the Proto channel values that it</span>
<span class="comment">// receives to perform the filtering action.</span>
<span class="comment">//</span>
<span class="comment">// Finally, a word on the entire point of this package: while it is named after</span>
<span class="comment">// the Proto type that pervades it and guides its syntax, the true nature of</span>
<span class="comment">// the `proto` package lies in cascading channels, rather than in dynamic</span>
<span class="comment">// typing. In fact this package might be more appropriately named after</span>
<span class="comment">// channels. Maybe `canal` would have been a better name. I wanted to bring</span>
<span class="comment">// the syntax and familiar patterns of functional programming idioms to the</span>
<span class="comment">// power and scalability of Go&#39;s goroutines and channels, and found that the</span>
<span class="comment">// syntax made this task very simple.</span>
<span class="comment">//</span>
<span class="comment">// You may find, as I did, that the majority of the code in this package is very</span>
<span class="comment">// &#39;obvious&#39;. At first I was concerned by this - much of the code is very</span>
<span class="comment">// trivial - but now I feel pleased by the re-usability and natural</span>
<span class="comment">// &#39;correctness&#39; of `proto`. Look at this package not as some monumental</span>
<span class="comment">// time-saving framework, but rather as a light scaffold for a useful and</span>
<span class="comment">// idiomatic style of programming within the existing constructs of Go.</span>
